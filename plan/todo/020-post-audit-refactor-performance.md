# Post-Audit Refactor And Performance Pass

## Goal

Continue the post-audit hardening work after the first architecture audit was completed. Prioritize measured renderer
performance, shared terminal/web workbench projections, and oversized module reduction without destabilizing demos.

## Initial Findings

- `app/api_workbench.ts` remains the largest app source at roughly 5.1k lines.
- `examples/web/api_workbench_page.ts` still mirrors substantial terminal workbench behavior at roughly 2.7k lines.
- Three ASCII hot-loop micro-optimizations must be benchmarked carefully; dense-edge branch splits and no-edge ternary
  fast paths regressed local `three-ascii-ansi-grid` benchmarks and were not retained.
- Benchmark tooling should make targeted performance runs harder to misuse.

## Tasks

- [x] Add benchmark selector ergonomics and coverage for `--query` as a search alias.
- [ ] Extract another shared renderer-neutral workbench projection from terminal/web duplication.
- [ ] Re-run focused and full health checks after each retained milestone.
- [ ] Continue reducing oversized app/demo modules only at clean abstraction points.
- [ ] Keep Three ASCII performance changes benchmark-gated; revert any micro-optimization that loses on focused cases.
