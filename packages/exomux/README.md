# Exomux

A terminal multiplexer built on `@ubernaut/deno-tui`: a detachable local host owning PTY-backed shells, and a floating
workbench client that can exit and reattach without disturbing them.

## Running

```sh
deno task start          # from this directory
deno task --cwd packages/exomux start   # from the repository root
```

`deno task exomux` at the repository root delegates here. `--memory` skips layout persistence, `--daemon` runs the host
alone (it requires a valid `EXOMUX_TOKEN` and is normally started for you by the client).

## Why this is a separate package

Exomux has its own `deno.json` and its own `deno.lock`, and it is deliberately **not** a Deno workspace member. A
workspace shares one npm resolution, and `deno compile` materializes all of it rather than just the module graph — as a
workspace member or as a file inside the library's own config, the compiled binary carried roughly 48MB of packages it
never imports (esbuild and its platform binaries, three.js, the image codecs). Resolved against this config it is
122.5MB instead of 170.4MB, with the dependency set still fully locked.

## Depending on the library

The library is reached exclusively through its public entrypoints, aliased in `deno.json`:

| alias                         | today                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `@ubernaut/deno-tui`          | `../../mod.ts`          |
| `@ubernaut/deno-tui/app`      | `../../mod.app.ts`      |
| `@ubernaut/deno-tui/terminal` | `../../mod.terminal.ts` |
| `@ubernaut/deno-tui/testing`  | `../../mod.testing.ts`  |

No file here imports `../../src/...`. Once the library is published, those four path values become JSR specifiers and
nothing else changes — that is the whole point of routing them through the import map.

`@showcase/kit` still points into `examples/showcases/shared`, which Inkstone also uses. It supplies six symbols
(`ShowcaseKernel`, `createShowcaseTerminalStore`, `defineShowcaseManifest` and three provider types) and needs its own
home before Exomux can be published independently.

## Layout

Sources sit flat at the package root; `tests/` holds the suite. `main.ts` is the CLI entry, `mod.ts` the library
surface.
